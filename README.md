toads-adventure-py
==================

A 2D platformer inspired by
[_Super Mario Bros. 2_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._2),
developed using [Python 2.7](https://python.org) and
[PyGame 1.9](https://pygame.org) by [David C. Drake](https://davidcdrake.com).

Controls
--------
* Use the **arrow keys** or **WASD** to move, duck, and climb.
* Press the **space bar** to jump (NOTE: for now, unlike _Super Mario Bros. 2_,
jumping on enemies will damage the player).
