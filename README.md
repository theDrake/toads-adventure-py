toads-adventure-py
==================

A 2D platformer inspired by [_Super Mario Bros. 2_]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._2), developed using
[Python 2.7](http://python.org/download/) and [PyGame 1.9]
(http://pygame.org/download.shtml) by [David C. Drake](http://davidcdrake.com).

Controls
--------
* Use the **arrow keys** or **WASD** to move, duck, and climb.
* Press the **space bar** to jump (NOTE: for now, unlike _Super Mario Bros. 2_,
jumping on enemies will damage the player).
