toads-adventure-py
==================

2D platformer inspired by
[_Super Mario Bros. 2_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._2).
Still in gradual development by [David C. Drake](https://davidcdrake.com) using
[Python 3](https://python.org), [Pygame](https://pygame.org), and
[Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org).

Controls
--------
* Use **arrow keys** or **WASD** to move, crouch, and climb.
* Press **space bar** to jump (for now, however, unlike _Super Mario Bros. 2_,
jumping on enemies will damage the player).
